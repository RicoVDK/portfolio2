# Rico's Softworks

## Description

Second rendition of my first portfolio website, initially created within the first week.

The current implementation is severely outdated and no longer represents my present skillset.

## Development

1. This project uses Gatsby. You will need the latest version of `gatsby-cli`.
To install, run `npm i --g gatsby-cli`.
2. Install project dependencies through `npm i --legacy-peer-deps`. You may also need to separately install `source-map`.
3. Run `export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider`
4. Run `gatsby develop`
5. Voila, `localhost:8000` is now yours.

## Branches
- `source`
  - Development.
- `main`
  - Production.
